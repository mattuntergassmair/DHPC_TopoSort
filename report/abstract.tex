	This short report gives a quick insight in topological sorting and the various problems that are associated with its parallelization.
	Building on existing algorithms, it suggests modified and optimized approaches to overcome these problems while making best use of state of the art computer hardware.
	In a discussion of the obtained benchmarks the performance of these approaches is analyzed and compared.
	Lastly, this report contains some suggestions regarding which graph types might profit from parallel topological sorting.
