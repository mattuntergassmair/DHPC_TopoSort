	This report gives a quick overview of topological sorting and the various problems that are associated with its parallelization.
	Building on a previously proposed algorithm, it suggests modifications to overcome the problems in an existing algorithm.
	In a discussion of the obtained benchmarks the performance of these approaches is analyzed and compared.
	Finally, this report highlights which graph types are suitable for parallel topological sorting.
