\mypar{Motivation}
\begin{invisible}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Software Dependencies
  \item Maybe, to flesh out: Admittedly a bit academic, but interesting problem nevertheless, because memory bound => This is the future of HPC
  \end{itemize}
\end{invisible}


\mypar{Related work} 
\begin{invisible}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item MC Er Paper \cite{er1983parallel}: Unclear how to retrieve a sorted list from values without sorting and threads might chase other threads. No words about load balancing => Not practicable
  \item Ma Paper \cite{ma1997efficient}: Theoretical analysis in PRAM model, not practicable.
  \item Both cases: No code
  \item Our contribution: (1) Modified algorithm based on MC Er. 1. Sorted list is directly extracted. 2. only one thread continues when multiple threads meet. 3. Ensure load balancing
                          (2) Actual implementation for shared memory architecture
